## Pig Game

This is a simple game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game is played by two players taking turns to roll a dice. The goal is to reach a score of 100 points before the other player.
How to play

    Click the "New Game" button to start a new game. This will reset the scores and the active player.

    Each turn, a player rolls the dice by clicking the "Roll Dice" button. 
    The number on the dice will be added to the current score of the active player.

    If a player rolls a 1, their turn is over, and their current score is reset to 0. 
    The other player then takes their turn.

    If a player wants to keep their score and end their turn, they can click the "Hold" button. 
    Their current score will be added to their total score, and it will become the other player's turn.

    The game ends when a player reaches a score of 100. The winner is then declared, and the game is over.
